            <p>
            Turtwig (Grass):
            Advantages: Grass types are strong against Water, Ground, and Rock types, providing an advantage against many early-game opponents.
            Considerations: You'll need to cover Turtwig's weaknesses to Fire, Ice, Poison, Flying, and Bug types.
            </p>

            <p>
                Chimchar (Fire):
                Advantages: Fire types are strong against Grass, Bug, Ice, and Steel types, giving you an edge against several Gym Leaders.
                Considerations: Chimchar is weak against Water, Ground, and Rock types. You'll need to counter these weaknesses in your team.

        <div class="start">
            <img src="https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/platinum/normal/piplup.png">
            <p>Piplup (Water):
                Advantages: Water types have an advantage over Fire, Ground, and Rock types, making it easier to handle several early-game challenges.
                Considerations: Piplup is weak against Electric and Grass types. Ensure your team covers these weaknesses effectively.

    <h2>Building a Balanced Team</h2>



    <p>Choosing a balanced Pokémon team is vital as it ensures diverse type coverage, adaptability to different opponents, and effective handling of threats. A balanced team allows players to counter various strategies, exploit opponents' weaknesses, and enhance their chances of winning battles and tournaments. It also adds depth and enjoyment to the gameplay experience by encouraging exploration of different Pokémon species and strategies, making the overall gameplay more satisfying and rewarding.</p>


    <p>Water Type (Piplup's Evolution):
        Choose a strong Water type like Empoleon. Water types are essential for surfing and navigating through the game. They also provide a good counter against Fire types. </p>

       <p> Flying Type (Starly's Evolution Line):
        Starly evolves into Staraptor, which is a great Flying type. Flying Pokémon are vital for travel and provide an advantage against Grass, Bug, and Fighting types.</p>

        <p>Ice or Dragon Type Move User (Consider Sneasel or Gible):
        Ice Type: Sneasel or its evolution Weavile can learn Ice moves, which are super effective against Cynthia's Garchomp. Ice types also counter Ground and Flying types.
        Dragon Type: Gible or its evolution Gabite can learn Dragon moves, which are strong against Dragon types, giving you an advantage against Garchomp as well.</p>

       <p>Additional Types for Coverage:
        Consider adding Pokémon with Electric moves (for Water and Flying types), Ground or Fighting moves (for Fire types), and Grass or Electric moves (for Water types) to cover additional weaknesses in your team.</p>
