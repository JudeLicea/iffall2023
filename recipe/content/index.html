                <li>3 Tbsp mayo</li>
                <li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>

            <h2> Recipe</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li> Preheat Oven to 425˚F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment or a silpat. Place salmon skin-side down, brush with olive oil and season with garlic salt and black pepper.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Bake uncovered for 10-15 min or just until cooked through (my thinner cut wild salmon was closer to 10 minutes). Remove from oven, cover with foil and rest ten minutes. Discard skin, flake salmon with forks, remove any bones, and cool to room temp while prepping remaining ingredients.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>Heat a medium skillet over medium heat. Add 1 Tbsp olive oil, 1 Tbsp butter and finely diced onion and bell pepper. Saute until softened and golden (7-9 minutes) then remove from heat.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine cooled flaked salmon, sautéed onion and pepper, 1 cup bread crumbs, 2 beaten eggs, 3 Tbsp mayo, 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp garlic salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper, and 1/4 cup fresh parsley. Stir to combine then form into 13-14 patties. I find it's easiest to portion the patties using a flat ice cream scoop then pressing them into 1/3 to 1/2″ thick patties.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>Heat 1 Tbsp oil and 1 Tbsp butter in a large pan over medium heat and once butter is done sizzling, add half of the salmon cakes and sauté 3 1/2 to 4 minutes per side or until golden brown and cooked through.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If salmon cakes brown too quickly, reduce heat. Remove to a paper-towel lined plate. Add remaining 1 Tbsp oil and 1 Tbsp butter and repeat cooking remaining salmon cakes.</li>
                </ol>

        <h2>Reference Sites</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Using the <a href="https://www.creatorburger.com/">creatorburger</a> is so much fun. There are so many little animations and pictures that make it more interactive and attention-grabbing. I want to eventually incorporate the different little animations and movements when you scroll, along with the creative layout of images and content. 
            </li>
            <li>Looking through the <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/home/">Patagonia</a> is always an easy and lovable task because of the communicative layout and assortment of buttons. The website makes it easy to understand what each aspect is, and how it works. The buttons have a super cool interactive aspect where the information slides up and covers the images when hovering over. I hope to use some of the buttons and horizontal scroll aspects. 
            </li>
            <li>The <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US">Xbox</a> website has a super cool display of content. When you scroll the next piece of content fills in the negative space, but it's not always symmetrical. The layout comes in like pieces and it's super satisfying to see it move into place. I would to display my images like this.
