         <ol> 
            <li> My name is Jude Licea and I'm a sophomore studying Cognitive Neuroscience with Human-Computer Interaction and Computer Science minors.  </li> <br>
            <li> I've always been fascinated by the brain and technology, and I want to study the bridge between the two.
                 I'm wanting to pursue a career in interaction product design, and I believe this class will help me develop some of the crucial skills required for the field.    </li> <br>
            <li> Over the summer, I did a little of the Mimo web development course, so I'm somewhat familiar with HTML and CSS. I know that HTML provides the blueprint for a site and CSS is responsible for style and design.    </li> <br> 
            <li> I hope to broaden my skills revolving around basic interaction principles so I can create a strong portfolio.   </li> <br>
            <li> When designing for a screen, there are more aspects that need attention and planning compared to paper, i.e. screen size, usability, links, and interactive features.       </li> <br>
            <li>  I think the <a href = "https://livefastdieyoung.com/en-us" > Live Fast Die Young</a>  site has an amazing layout, with a design that elegantly shows the company's products, stores, and current events. </li> <br>
            <li>  <a href = "https://www.apple.com/iphone/"> Apple's</a> iPhone website effectivley uses eye-catching icons, layout style, vibrant colors, stylish graphic design, and relevant facts to communicate their product to users.  </li> <br>
            <li>  Using the <a href = "https://www.rolex.com/en-us">Rolex</a> site is viusally pleasing and makes information easy to digest. The site's scroll feature is especially well-designed, along with having well-balanced colors and intentional placement of information.   </li> <br>
         </ol>
